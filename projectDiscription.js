----------  ABOUT BOOKING ROOM REACT APP DEVELOPMENT --------- 
The Booking Room React App is a user-friendly web application designed to facilitate seamless room reservations.
 Users can easily search for available rooms based on their preferences, such room type and room price. The intuitive
  interface allows users to filter results and view detailed information about each room, includingimages, pricing,
   and availability. Once they find a suitable option, they can proceed to book the room.

On the administrative side, the app empowers admins with essential tools to manage the room database effectively.
 Admins can add new rooms, edit existing room details, and delete rooms that are no longer available. The admin
  dashboard is designed for ease of use, allowing for quick navigation and efficient management of the room listings,
   ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.
